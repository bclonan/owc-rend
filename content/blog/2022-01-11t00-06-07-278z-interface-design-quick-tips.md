### Legibility and Scannability

Written words make up [95% of the information on the web](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period?source=post_page). With this fact in mind, it’s safe to say that typography plays an important role in interface design. Poor legibility impedes user progress while low scannability can lead to overwhelming cognitive loads and decreased productivity. Adhering to good typography practices in regard to layout, hierarchy, sizing, and more ensures the information being presented is easily consumable by all user types.

### Flexibility

Power users, more than any other user type, benefit from the ability to tailor interfaces to fit their unique needs. Fully configurable layouts, customizable font sizing, and smart filtering are all excellent ways to provide users with increased flexibility within an interface.

Gmail, for example, offers great flexibility for users looking to customize their email experience. In addition to various filtering, sorting, and search features, they’ve included three options for adjusting display density within inboxes. 

### Intelligence

The beauty of software is its ability to grow more intelligent over time. Power users benefit from systems that know what information is most useful and where and how it should be displayed at any given moment.

This type of intelligent design is perfectly illustrated by Pinterest’s interface. The homepage presents users with an array of content they might be interested in that seamlessly updates with more related content as users scroll and interact. The action of saving pins is made sweeter by the inclusion of suggested boards based on previous interactions with the platform. Two clicks or less and it’s done. At every touchpoint, Pinterest succeeds at streamlining the experience by learning users’ behaviors and adapting to meet their needs.

### Good Onboarding

When done correctly, onboarding flows transform new users into power users by increasing complexity in stages over time. Similar to video games, users should demonstrate mastery of basic skills before being given the ability to perform new, more complex tasks.

Quickbook’s approach to onboarding succeeds by exposing users to what features are available from the start. Users are given the freedom to explore as their skillset allows. For those that are new to the platform, a clear path to follow is given as they become familiar with the product. This method of progressive mastery sets a strong foundation for getting work done and ensures that they aren’t overwhelmed from the outset. On the flip side, power users are still free to bypass simpler flows and dive directly into more complex tasks if they wish. In both scenarios, the needs of both user types are equally satisfied.

Design trends come and go, but it is important to remember that when it comes to information density within interfaces, sometimes more *is* more. Through thoughtful consideration for your different user types and their unique needs, decisions about appropriate levels of information density can be made.
